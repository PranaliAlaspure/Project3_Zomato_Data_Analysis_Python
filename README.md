This project analyzes Zomato's dataset to uncover trends in restaurant operations, cuisines, price ranges, and customer ratings. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights and visualizations for better decision-making in the food industry.
I used three main libraries of python to solve this project like Pandas for data manupulation,Numpy for numerical operation and seaborn,matplotlib for viualization.
I used countplot for showing type of restuarant and majority of choosing restuarants by people and conclusion was dining catagory is most like by people among Buffet,Cafes and others.
I used line plot for showing trend of which restuarants was popular ang dining restuarant was getting maximum votes.
I used Hist plot for showing rating distribution among the restuarants and its beatween 3.5 t0 4.
I used boxplot for showing online orders and its rating distribution and heatmap for showing online order getting from which restuarants most.
Conclusion of my project was Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders,whereas cafes primarily receive online orders.
This suggests that clients prefer to place orders at resturants ,but prefer online ordering at cafes.
